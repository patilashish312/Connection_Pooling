# Connection_Pooling.

This is very simple Spring boot based rest template connection pooling example. 
Used HttpClient for creating rest template. Also, used one 'third party free consumption service' for calling and verification purpose.

2 rest template beans got created--one is default & another is pooled one. Beans got differentiated by name.
